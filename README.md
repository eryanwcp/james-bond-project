# james-bond-project

Hi,

This Sky Software Engineering Academy test has been developed in Java with dropwizard Java framework.

For that reason the project does not require any .war file. 

Once the project is checked out please run the line below in your project directory,

java -jar target/james-bond-project-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar server src\external\conf\james-bond-config.yml

In addition to this, Bootstrap and AngularJS JavaScript frameworks have also been used to produce a web page with a programme guide of Sky's 007 channel.
